# 🌦️ WeatherMate

## 📌 Project Overview
WeatherMate is a weather application developed to provide real-time weather updates using external APIs.  
The goal of the project was to strengthen my understanding of API integration, frontend development, and presenting real-time data in a structured and user-friendly way.  

The app allows users to search for a city and get instant weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a city name in the search bar.  
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. The API responds with real-time weather data.  
4. The data is displayed in a structured format on the UI.
